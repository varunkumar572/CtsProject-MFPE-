MEDI-CARE system using Spring Boot and Reactjs

MEDI-CARE is to computerize hospital front-office management by developing software that is user-friendly, quick, and cost-effective. It deals with gathering patient information, diagnosis data, and so on. The MEDI-CARE includes the operations like registration of patient, problem creation, and receipt creation. It also includes storing the details of patients, viewing receipts, details and so on.
The software may provide each patient an unique id and save clinical information as well as hospital tests that are performed automatically. It has a search option to find out what each patient's current status is. A username and password are required to access the MEDI-CARE. It can be accessed by an administrator. They are the only ones who have access to the database to add, delete or update the data of patients. The data is well-protected for personal use, and it is processed quickly.
